                                    The chamber choir “Lyra” was founded in 1974, by the initiative of some men from Buzău, who loved choral music, among whom there was the teacher Ștefan Stănescu, the conductor of the choir.
                                    <br>
                                    In these more than 42 years of ceaseless activity, “Lyra” has represented the Buzău town and even Romania at several festivals and contests with national and international participation. This famous activity has been based not only on the talent and love for music of its 40 member s, most of them being primary school or kindergarten teachers, but also on the conductor’s lifetime passion, Ștefan Stănescu, who has faithfully served this kind of music for more than 46 years.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Under his leading, “Lyra” has won important awards at national contests in many cities of Romania and also at some well-known festivals in France, Greece, Switzerland, Check Republic, Slovakia, Portugal, Italy, Austria, FYROM, Bulgaria, Turkey, Croatia, Montenegro, representing a great confirmation of the choir’s value, based both on the wealth of the repertoire, over 160 plays of great popularity from the Romanian and international contemporary music, and on the quality of the interpretation.

                                    The Chamber Choir “Helü” was founded in 2004. Initially a project-based choir, it has grown into a tightly knit group of people who enjoy coming together to sing every week. The choir gathers in the South Estonian town of Tartu and its name Helü means “sound” in local dialect.
