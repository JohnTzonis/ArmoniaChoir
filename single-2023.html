                      <br>
                      <p>
                         All kinds of choirs can participate in the non-competitive festivities of our festival. Working on the direction of its greater spread worldwide, we would like to inform that you will all find out an attractive destination that manages to combine both high artistic value and quality, as well as the advantages of a beautiful tour, as our region is full of archaeological sites from the Ancient Hellenic period and areas of great natural beauty, too.  Besides, staying in Preveza could be an opportunity both for day trips to the surrounding area and excursions to the greater area of our precinct.
                      </p>
                      <br>

                      <br>
                      <p>
                         Participating non-competitively gives choirs the opportunity to present informal performances in various locations across the city, while having the possibility to meet with other choirs, see some of Preveza’s beautiful countryside and attend all the festival’s manifestations. Non-competitive choirs are free to organize their own tourist activities while here but are asked to please keep the organizing committee informed as their itinerary comes together to ensure that no time-tabling cross over occurs. Different kinds of performances could be organised in cooperation with the participants. Opportunities to perform in different Greek cities (Lefkas, Ioannina, and Agrinio) are possible to be organised after choirs ask.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <h3>Timetable</h3>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                         The place and the time of the non-competitive concerts will be arranged by the Organizing Committee that will also choose which choirs will participate in each concert.  Pieces of each choir's choice (with a preference for sacred or folklore works) will be performed "a cappella" within 10-15 minutes.
                      </p>

                         Each choir is responsible for all matters related to the organization, booking and payment of all accommodation and meals during their stay in Preveza. A comprehensive list of specially negotiated accommodation options in varied price ranges (including hotels, guest houses and restaurants) will be provided to all choirs selected to participate in our festival. The festival is not responsible for any booking issues that may arise. Despite belonging to the Greek mainland, Preveza has an islandish character. And since it has numerous kinds of touristic facilities, it is a destination ideal for people of many different economic backgrounds.

For 2 full meals (lunch – dinner) calculate 25 – 30€ per person richly, so for 4 days of food calculate at 100-120€ per person.
