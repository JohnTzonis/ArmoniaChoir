                  The choral activities at Ljubljana Conservatory of Music and Ballet started progressing after composer and conductor Ambrož Čopi assumed leadership of the choir in 2010 , knowing how important and fulfilling it is for young musicians to sing in a choir, to discover the beauty of vocal music and the joy of singing together with others, feeling the energy and power of choral art and getting inspired for future work.
                  <br><br>
                  After four years of growing quality and various achivements at competitions: first place at International choral festival Samoborsko zborsko protuletje (Croatia, 2011), first place in mixed choirs and chamber choirs categories at International choral festival in Gdansk (Poland, 2012), Grand prix at Festival of contemporary music Canti veris Praga (Czech Republic, 2013), first place at National competition of children’s and youth choirs Zagorje ob Savi (Slovenia, 2012), second place at International Choral competition ''Gallus'' Maribor (Slovenia, 2013), third place at International Choral competition Montreux (Swizerland, 2014), the decision was made to split the choir into two groups - one choir consists of all the students of the conservatory not included in school orchestras, the other choir (Chamber choir) consists of about 40 singers who are willing to improve their vocal technique, to sing a more difficult range of choral music and reach higher performing standards.

                  The Chamber choir KGBL, led by Ambrož Čopi and two assistants Tine Bec and Evgen Bibianko, embraces a wide range of music genres and styles, from the Renaissance to modern music. Special attention is given to compositions by contemporary Slovene composers. In the past three years the choir had commissioned many prominent composers such as Lojze Lebič, Tadeja Vulc, Damijan Močnik, Črt Sojar-Voglar, Peter Šavli, Andrej Makor for their choral works and encouraged the youngest generation of composers Tine Bec, Matej Kastelic to create new compositions, which the choir successfully promotes at concerts and competitions in Slovenia and abroad.
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    In the past three years the choir earned second and third place at International Choral competition Talinn (Estonia, 2015), won Grand prix at International festival in Moscow (Russia, 2016), first place at National choral competition ''Naša pesem'' (Our song), Maribor (Slovenia, 2016), second place at International Choral competition ''Gallus'' Maribor (Slovenia, 2017). The latest achievement is first place in Polifonia and second place in Folklore category at International choral competition in Tolosa (Spain, 2017). The choir successfuly performed concerts in various cities: Stockholm (Sweden, 2016), Borja, Ordizia, Getxo, Doneztebe (Spain, 2017) and at a variety of concert cycles in Slovenia.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The conductor's idea to make synergy between a new generation of young singers, composers and conductors became true. In collaboration with Slovenian music publisher Astrum new compositions by Slovenian composers are successfully promoted. After three years the Chamber Choir KGBL has become one of the most prominent Slovenian choirs.
