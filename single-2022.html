          It is universally accepted that in the last two years we are going
          through a health crisis, unprecedented for all of us. Major music
          events were postponed or sought to keep pace with other forms of
          events, such as online events, etc.
          <br /><br />
          The Choral Society “Armonia” of Preveza with a particularly high sense
          of duty to protect public health, adapted the last 2 festivals
          accordingly, both in 2020 and 2021, maintaining on the one hand the
          high level of its events, and on the other hand paying attention to
          giving special importance to the health protocols, wanting to protect
          the health of the inhabitants of our area, as well as of the
          participating choirs. And so, we reach 2022 and our festival will
          celebrate 40 years of continuous supply in our city, in our country,
          in the global choral development.
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            For this reason, we decided to interlard it with two more events,
            thus completing the package of our choral events. So, this year we
            plan and will organize the following events within the framework of
            Preveza International Choral Festival:
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              The 40th International Choir Festival of Preveza, in which all
              kinds of choirs can participate, without repertoire restrictions,
              while concerts will be given in various cultural places in the
              region. It is an opportunity for participants to combine the
              enjoyment of a beautiful artistic event, while combining their
              vacation in an area that Forbes, as well as other international
              media rank in the top ten travel destinations for leisure.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              The 26th International Choir Competition, which was canceled 2
              years ago due to the pandemic. One of the most prestigious
              competitions in the world, which is famous for its reliability and
              validity internationally. The guarantors of this are the members
              of the international jury committee that make them up, musicians
              of world-renowned value and prestige, who, in addition to their
              appreciation for the level of each choir, constructively advise
              the choirs for their further development and advancement in the
              choir.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              The 5th Seminar for Choir Conductors, where the participants are
              given the opportunity to further specialize their knowledge in
              choral practice, gaining new knowledge and practices from renowned
              conductors worldwide. At the same time, they are given the
              opportunity to practice this new knowledge, conducting the seminar
              choir, which is usually among the best choirs in the world.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              This year for the first time we are organizing the 1st Choral
              Composition Competition and we invite all choral music composers
              from all over the world to participate. Our goal is to highlight
              new musical works, where the middle choir will be able to perform
              them. The winners, in addition to the joy of presenting their
              works at the festival, as well as a few other choirs at various
              events, will have the opportunity to publish their work in
              collaboration with a specific music production company,
              specialized in choral compositions. Also, the jury consists of the
              global best team of composers of choral music and choir
              conductors, which is a great honor for our organization.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              Finally, we will organize just before the festival and the seminar
