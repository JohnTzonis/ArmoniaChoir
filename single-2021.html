                <p>
                  Mark your calendar for July 2021 to be part of the 39th
                  International Choral Festival of Preveza. The festival will be
                  held from 5 to 11 of July 2021 in Preveza. The International
                  Choral Festival of Preveza counts 38 interesting and exciting
                  years of high quality choral music, challenged by excellent
                  choirs which are continuously raising its standards and a
                  great variety of intercultural experiences with participants
                  from all over the world. The Festival includes numerous
                  concerts given at idyllic locations of the area like the
                  seaside fortress of Preveza and the historic Ancient
                  Auditorium of Nikopolis “Odeon”. The other part of the
                  Festival is the prestigious competition for which through the
                  years we have been honored to have internationally been
                  acclaimed experts of the field overseas. Last, but not least a
                  seminar for choral conductors is organized annually with the
                  participation of conductors all around the world. For visiting
                  choirs, Preveza provides an opportunity not only to perform;
                  but also to experience some of the world’s best choral music,
                  soak up the atmosphere and enjoy the mingling, singing and
                  fun, and explore the picturesque city of Preveza and its
                  surrounds. The festival will be managed by the Choral Society
                  "Armonia" of Preveza, under the patronage of the city of
                  Preveza. Choirs are eligible to join the festival either as
                  non-competitive choirs participating in all the performances
                  of the festival, or as competitive choirs.

                    <p>
                      All kinds of choirs can participate in the non-competitive
                      festivities of our festival. Working on the direction of its
                      greater spread worldwide, we would like to inform that you will
                      all find out a really attractive destination that manages to
                      combine both high artistic value and quality, as well as the
                      advantages of a beautiful tour, as our region is full of
                      archaeological sites from the Ancient Hellenic period and areas
                      of great natural beauty, too. Besides, staying in Preveza could
                      be an opportunity both for day trips to the surrounding area and
                      excursions to the greater area of our precinct.

                    <p>
                      Participating non-competitively gives choirs the opportunity to
                      present informal performances in various locations across the
                      city, while having the possibility to meet with other choirs,
                      see some of Preveza’s beautiful countryside and attend all the
                      festival’s manifestations. Non-competitive choirs are free to
                      organize their own tourist activities while here, but are asked
                      to please keep the organizing committee informed as their
                      itinerary comes together to ensure that no time-tabling cross
                      over occurs. Different kinds of performances could be organised
                      in cooperation with the participants. Opportunities to perform
                      in different Greek cities (Lefkas, Ioannina, and Agrinio) are
                      possible to be organised after choirs ask.
