The name of the ensemble expresses the choir’s place of origin (Quinqueecclesiae being the Medieval name of the city) and its intention is to perform and propagate a high-quality repertoire, which includes pieces by lesser known Renaissance and Romantic composers, as well as 20th and 21st century works, with a significant emphasis on contemporary Hungarian choral pieces. Fostering contemporary Hungarian choral music plays an important role in their activity. It is a significant participant in the musical life of Pécs, but also performs in Budapest and other locations, often performing world premieres of newly composed pieces. Since its creation, it has won several prizes. Namely: the qualification “gold with certificate of merit” from the Association of Hungarian Choirs and Orchestras in 2014, a gold diploma at the VII Kodály Zoltán Choir Competition in Budapest in 2015, the 2nd prize and the prize for best conductor at the Vándor-Révész International Choir Competition in Budapest in 2018, and a 2nd prize and the prize for the best performance of Renaissance at the Ohrid International Choir Competition in North Macedonia in 2023.

In 2022, Raimonds Gulbis became its conductor, who has raised the choir's artistic quality to an even higher level since then. "Mītava" is a member of the Song and dance Festival movement, whose individuality is formed by a diverse selection of repertoire - from folk songs and original compositions to jazz and contemporary, popular and pop music. It also participates in various international competitions and festivals every year with considerable success. The set of human qualities of the choir is characterized by its prevailing mood and attitude towards work - "Mitavians" are characterized by the fact that the song accompanies them in all moments of being together - not only during rehearsals and performances, but also during trips and leisure activities.

                     <h3>Introduction</h3>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                         The International Choral Festival of Preveza is an institution of high artistic quality, both in the Greek and in the international choral field. More than 400 choirs from all over the world have been on its stage, while great personalities have been accredited to its International Jury Committee with their presence, guaranteeing with their glory for the artistic status of the festival as well as the reliability of its procedures.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <h3>Participation</h3>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                         All kinds of choirs can participate in the non-competitive festivities of our festival. Working on the direction of its greater spread worldwide, we would like to inform that you will all find out an attractive destination that manages to combine both high artistic value and quality, as well as the advantages of a beautiful tour, as our region is full of archaeological sites from the Ancient Hellenic period and areas of great natural beauty, too.  Besides, staying in Preveza could be an opportunity both for day trips to the surrounding area and excursions to the greater area of our precinct.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <h3>Organisation</h3>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                         Participating non-competitively gives choirs the opportunity to present informal performances in various locations across the city, while having the possibility to meet with other choirs, see some of Preveza’s beautiful countryside and attend all the festival’s manifestations. Non-competitive choirs are free to organize their own tourist activities while here but are asked to please keep the organizing committee informed as their itinerary comes together to ensure that no time-tabling cross over occurs. Different kinds of performances could be organised in cooperation with the participants. Opportunities to perform in different Greek cities (Lefkas, Ioannina, and Agrinio) are possible to be organised after choirs ask.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <h3>Timetable</h3>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                         The place and the time of the non-competitive concerts will be arranged by the Organizing Committee that will also choose which choirs will participate in each concert.  Pieces of each choir's choice (with a preference for sacred or folklore works) will be performed "a cappella" within 10-15 minutes.
                      </p>

                         Each choir is responsible for all matters related to the organization, booking and payment of all accommodation and meals during their stay in Preveza. A comprehensive list of specially negotiated accommodation options in varied price ranges (including hotels, guest houses and restaurants) will be provided to all choirs selected to participate in our festival. The festival is not responsible for any booking issues that may arise. Despite belonging to the Greek mainland, Preveza has an islandish character. And since it has numerous kinds of touristic facilities, it is a destination ideal for people of many different economic backgrounds.

For 2 full meals (lunch – dinner) calculate 25 – 30€ per person richly, so for 4 days of food calculate at 100-120€ per person.
