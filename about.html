              <p>
                Children's Choir "Armonia" of Preveza was founded in 1983 by Mr
                Andronikos Kourouklis. It is a part of the Choral Society
                "Armonia" of Preveza, founded in 1969. Its aim is to disseminate
                the choral ideal in the Preveza pedagogue and to prepare a
                suitable nursery for the mixed choir. From 1983 to 1990, under
                the direction of Stavros Solomos, it began its upward course,
                surpassing the stage of the pre-children's choir & acquiring its
                own artistic substance. In 1985, at the Choir Festival of
                Kifissia, it received its first award (1st prize in the
                performance of folklore editing) and in 1990 it won the silver
                medal in the category of Children's Choirs at the International
                Choral Festival of Athens. At the same time it organized and
                conducted in Preveza the 1st & 2nd Choral Workshop, under the
                guidance of the prominent musician Professor Stephanos
                Vassiliadis. In 1988 it gave concerts in the former
                Czechoslovakia in 1989 and in Bulgaria. From 1990 to 1994, the
                choir was directed by Valentin Stefanov, who created a
                department of small children, where, besides vocal preparation,
                they were taught theory of music & sophistication. In this way
                new children were admitted to the children's choir for the
                renewal of their living material. Since 1994 the choir has been
                taken over by Anelia Stefanovova. Under her direction, the choir
                participated in a number of choral competitions and won awards
                at international competitions in Dobrich (Bulgaria), Athens
                International Choral Festival, Arezzo (Italy), Neuchatel
                (Switzerland) and Nyiregyhaza (Hungary). It is noteworthy that
                the Children's Choir of Preveza "ARMONIA" is the only Greek
                Choir that has been awarded to those two great international
                choir competitions. In 1997 it collaborated with the Chamber
