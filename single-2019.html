										Mark your calendar for July 2019 to be part of the 37th International Choral Festival of Preveza. The festival will be held from 4 to 7 of July 2019 in Preveza. The International Choral Festival of Preveza counts 36 interesting and exciting years of high quality choral music, challenged by excellent choirs which are continuously raising its standards and a great variety of intercultural experiences with participants from all over the world. The Festival includes numerous concerts given at idyllic locations of the area like the seaside fortress of Preveza and the historic Ancient Auditorium of Nikopolis “Odeon”. The other part of the Festival is the prestigious competition for which through the years we have been honored to have internationally been acclaimed experts of the field overseas. For visiting choirs, Preveza provides an opportunity not only to perform; but also to experience some of the world’s best choral music, soak up the atmosphere and enjoy the mingling, singing and fun, and explore the picturesque city of Preveza and its surrounds. The festival will be managed by the Choral Society "Armonia" of Preveza, under the patronage of the city of Preveza. Choirs are eligible to join the festival either as non-competitive choirs participating in all the performances of the festival, or as competitive choirs.

                                    The Charité Chor Berlin (CCB) consists of approx. 35 musically enthusiastic singers and was founded in 2013 by conductor Adrian Emans. The choir was originally intended for the students of the medical school “Charité” in Berlin, but in the following years, students and young professionals from many other disciplines joined the group. Since its establishment it has been an important part of the Berlin choir scene. Its repertoire spans the choral literature from the 16th to 20th century, with pieces from the Renaissance to modern compositions. The highlights of the choir’s calendar are its own concerts, which are organized at least two times a year. Past major achievements have included a concert in the Berliner Philharmonie and numerous awards in several choir competitions.
                                    It is directed by <b>Mr. Adrian Emans</b>.

                                    In 1979 Ms. Lucy Lin and Ms. Ling Tang founded Tung-Hsin Choral Society in Washington, D.C., the first full-fledged Chinese-American chorus in the region. Literally, “Tung-Hsin” means young at heart, and connotes more closely to purity and vitality. Over the forty years, the group has performed on 136 occasions at such venues as the Kennedy Center, the Lincoln Center, and the National Theater, the F. Scott Fitzgerald Theatre, the local museums, churches and high school auditoriums. In addition to the 2016 concert tour in Ireland during the 60th Cork International Choral Festival, the group has performed in Boston, New York, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Ottawa, Taiwan, Quemoy, Hong Kong. Special topical concerts include: A Concert Celebration of Ancient Chinese Poetry, A Concert of Healing (at Johns Hopkins University Hospital,) and A Concert Celebration of the Theme Songs of films and musicals. Tung-Hsin’s repertoire encompasses a well-rounded domain - from the composers of the 16th century to the contemporaries, from the Western music to the Chinese – including sacred pieces, art songs, choral works from opera, theme songs from films, and the Broadway musical hits. The incumbent president is Dr. Keh-Ming Lu.
                                    The current conductor is the choir’s founder, <b>Lucy Lee Lin</b>.
