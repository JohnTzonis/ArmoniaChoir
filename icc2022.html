                                ''I have been following the Preveza International Choir Festival for many years. Really exceptional organizational work, which allows the choirs good presentations, unforgettable memories, and experiences that they carry with them for a long time. I am happy that choirmasters and a competition for composers and conductors added to this year's edition, raise this exceptional festival to an even higher level. It was with great satisfaction that we reviewed and evaluated the received compositions. Composers were limited to 4-5 voices in the A category and to 2-3 voices in the B category with the possibility of using the piano. Technically, the compositions had to be suitable for good choirs, thus enabling the wider applicability of the compositions. Subject to limitations, however, a few compositions were artistically weightily designed and awarded. There were no visible searches or excesses, but we gained quite a few interesting novelties, which the choirs would definitely like to include in their repertoire. The work of the jury took place in a good atmosphere and exchange of views. I thank all the members of the jury for their dedicated and professional work.''
