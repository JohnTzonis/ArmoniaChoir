                  The <b>Children’s Choir “Armonia”</b> of Preveza was founded
                  in 1983 by the conductor Mr Andronikos Kourouklis and it is a
                  section of the Choral Society “Armonia” of Preveza. Other
                  conductors of the choir who greatly contributed to its
                  brilliant course and success were Stavros Solomos and Valentin
                  Stefanov. Since 1994, the choir has been directed by
                  <b>Anelia Stefanova</b>. During its existence the choir has
                  been awarded 2 first, 2 second and 2 third prizes in
                  International Choral Competitions (Bulgaria, Greece, Italy,

                  the best Greek Children’s choir in the International Choral
                  Festival of Athens. It regularly performs in festivals both in

                  Members of <b>Voci Contra Tempo</b> are classically trained
                  singers who are passionate about choral music. The core of the
                  ensemble consists of 16 members, but varies in size according
                  to the needs of each individual project. Even though the
                  ensemble has been active for a short time, it has already made
                  an impact in the Greek and international choral music scene.
                  Voci Contra Tempo has collaborated with Thessaloniki’s State
                  Symphony Orchestra, among others, presenting some of the main
                  works for female choir, such as The Planets by Gustav Holst
                  and Les Sirènes from Claude Debussy’s Nocturnes. They have
                  performed at important venues such as the Thessaloniki Megaron
                  Concert Hall and the historical Parnassus Athens Hall. In
                  August 2021 the ensemble made its international debut after
                  having been invited to participate in some of the most
                  prestigious choral festivals in Europe: the “Guido d’Arezzo
                  International Choral Festival” and the “Incontro
                  Internazionale Polifonico ‘Città di Fano’”. The choir has been
                  directed by Sofia Gioldasi.
